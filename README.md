# onlinecounter

A fun little widget to stick on your site to show popularity and give your guests some entertainment.

Run server with simple `go run src/main.rs`.

Run a http server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from inside the onlinecounter directory.

Then simply visit localhost:8000 to see it in action. Open a couple tabs to see the effect of multiple users. Drag around the objects for a little fun.
